# CS 190 Lab 1 (Spring 2017) - What Does the _____ Say? 

The purpose of this lab is to teach the basics of using the terminal. After you finish this lab, you will be able to manipulate files on any UNIX-like machine (including your Purdue CS account)!

## The Lab 

Before starting the lab, you might want to check out the [Lecture 1 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-S2017/blob/master/labs/lab1/lecture01-basic-terminal-commands.md) to review all the common commands. 

Throughout this lab we will give you specific goals and you will have to write the appropriate command to fulfill that goal. The catch is that **all answers should only contain one command** (`mv`, `cp`, `rm`, etc.). 


### The Magic Command 
    cd; curl -sL https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-S2017/raw/master/labs/lab1/lab1init | bash

When you run the command above, the starting folder structure for this lab will be created in your home `~` directory. If you mess anything up in this lab and want to start over, you can run this command. Be careful though, since this will erase your progress.


### Folder Structure 
Below is the folder structure that is generated from running the "Magic Command". As you can see, there are some problems. For example, dog sounds are in the cat/sounds folder. Throughout this lab, you will write terminal commands that fix some of the mistakes.

                └── human_whistle


## Rules and Example Task 
There are 6 tasks, and you will write 6 **one line** terminal commands that fulfill that task. Each command may only contain **ONE BASE COMMAND** (`mv`, `ls`, `cp`, `rm`, etc). You may not combine different base commands (`cd`, `mv`) into one response, and you may not combine two of the same base commands (`mv`, `mv`) into one response. Examples of this are below in the *Task 0 Example*.

**All commands should be recorded in answers.txt.** To download the answer sheet below, right-click on the file and click "Save File As" and save it to your **Downloads** folder.

[answers.txt Download Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-S2017/master/labs/lab1/answers.txt)

> NOTE: Do not save this file within `~/cs190lab1` because that folder and all of its contents will be erased each time you run the "Magic Script"


#### Example: Task 0 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/

    Desired Action:     print out only the names of the normal folders and files in the cat/ folder and the dog/ folder

    Write the answer under the Task 0 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Example: Task 0 Sample Answer 
    # -----------------
    # Task 0 Answer
    # -----------------
    ls cat dog

This above answer is allowed because it is on one line and only contains one base command, which in this case, is a single `ls`. Example invalid responses are shown below.

    # Not allowed response because it is two lines and contains two "ls" commands.
    ls cat
    ls dog

    # Not allowed response because it contains two "ls" commands.
    ls cat; ls dog

    # Not allowed because it is four lines and contains more than one base command.
    cd cat
    ls
    cd ../dog
    ls


## Assigned Tasks 
Solve all 6 of these tasks, and record your answers in the `answers.txt` file. 

#### Task 1 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/

    Desired Action:     remove the human/ folder from the working directory

    Write the answer under the Task 1 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Task 2 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/

    Desired Action:     create a folder named mouse/ with the subfolders [sounds] and [famous mice]  
                        (may not use MORE THAN TWO path arguments)
                        (mkdir one/ two/ three/  # this has three path arguments)

    Write the answer under the Task 2 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Task 3 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/

    Desired Action:     move the dog sounds from the cat/sounds/ folder to dog/sounds/ folder
                        (may not explicitly list files in command)

    Write the answer under the Task 3 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Task 4 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/dog

    Desired Action:     rename the folder [famous cows] to [famous dogs]

    Write the answer under the Task 4 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Task 5 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/fox/sounds

    Desired Action:     copy [ding ding ding] to a new file named [ding ding ding ding]

    Write the answer under the Task 5 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.

#### Task 6 

    Working Directory:  ~/cs190lab1/cat/sounds

    Desired Action:     move files that are cat sounds from parent directory (~/cs190lab1/cat)
                        to the current working directory
                        (may not use definite paths such as ~/cs190lab1/cat)

    Write the answer under the Task 6 block. Make sure not to put '#' before your answer.


#### End of Lab 
That was the last task! Before you leave...

* Make sure you check with a TA so we can give you credit!
* If you didn't finish before the end of the lab, email the `answers.txt` file to your TA. 
* Complete the `homework` section below sometime before your next lab. 
* If you want to learn more, take a look at the `Extra Fun` section below. 


##Homework

There's a few accounts you'll want to sign up for if you haven't already. We will be using them later in the course.

* Github is awesome, so sign up when you get the chance. If you use your Purdue email, you'll get some extra stuff for free. You can click [here](https://education.github.com) for more information.
* Sign up for the [CS 190 Piazza](https://piazza.com/purdue/spring2017/cs190/home) if you haven't already. This will help you stay informed about what's going on in the class. 

<!---
* While you're at it, you should apply to Purdue's hackathon [here](http://boilermake.org).

## Extra Fun 
Did you realize that you made a shell script that is actually runnable? As you saw in the default folder structure, files were all over the place and things were not in the correct locations, nor did they have the correct names. If you have the correct answers, you are able to run your answers.txt file as a script and it will result in a folder structure that makes sense.

If you want to run your answers.txt as a script, run the following command in the terminal:

    bash answers.txt

Now look at the entire folder structure of your `~/cs190lab1` folder by running the following command:

    ls -al ~/cs190lab1/*/*


## More Extra Fun 
View the [source](https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-S2017/blob/master/labs/lab1/lab1init) of the Magic script. You know almost everything that is going on in this script!
